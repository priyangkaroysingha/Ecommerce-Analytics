# Ecommerce-Analytics
- Here we used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicer
- Created connections, join new tables, calculated to manipulate data, and enable user-driven parameters for visualization
- In this dashboard, we used a stacked bar chart to show the profit and loss in sales by month
- Then we used the donut chart to show the sum of quantity by category and payment mode
- Then again, we used a bar chart to show the maximum profit by sub-category and the top 5 states' contribution in amount.

- Overall, we got some insight that January, March, and November are the most profitable month. Among the category, clothes sold the most (63%) and in the sub-category, printers are contributing to maximum profit (8.6k). Therefore our target should be the clothing in Maharashtra state in January, March, and November months to increase sales.
